# ⭐ Pattern Printing in Java

This Java program prints **two different star patterns** using nested `while` loops. It's a great beginner exercise for understanding nested loops and formatting output.

## 📋 Features

* Prints two distinct triangle-like star patterns:

  * **Pattern 1:** Increasing stars per line (left-aligned)
  * **Pattern 2:** Decreasing stars per line (left-aligned)
* Demonstrates use of `while` loops and nested logic.
